# Puzzle PETA

## Participate, Learn, Solve and Be Part of [Exzeo](http://exzeo.com)

##### Looking for dynamic, aspiring and self motivated developer to be part of Exzeo Team

##### We have some exiting puzzles for all you interesting people out there to tease your brain !!!

All below puzzles are mandatory to solved to participate. Developers can write a simple Console Application
to showcase the solutions


**Problem 1:**

> A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

> Write a Program that tells about a Number is Perfect Number or not?


**Problem 2:**

> Download "names.txt", There are over five-thousand first names. Read this file into your program and sort them by alphabetical order. You have to figure out value for each name. How to calculate the value is as follows:

> 1. Get the sum of place value of each character(a=1,b=2,etc.).
> 2. Multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

> For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, ADDY, which is worth 1 + 4 + 4 + 25 = 35, is the 100th name in the list. So ADDY would obtain a score of 35 × 100 = 3500.

> What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

**Problem 3:**

> Find the smallest x + y + z with integers x > y > z > 0 such that x + y, x − y, x + z, x − z, y + z, y − z are all perfect squares.
